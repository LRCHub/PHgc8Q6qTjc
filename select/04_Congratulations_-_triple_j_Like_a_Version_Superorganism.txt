(One, two, three)
Here's a useful lesson for ya
Give up, just quit, because in this life, you can't win
Yeah, you can try
But in the end you're just gonna lose
Big time, because the world is run by the man

My mama called, seen you on TV, son
Said shit done changed ever since we was on
I dreamed it all ever since I was young
They said I wouldn't be nothing
Now they always say, "Congratulations"
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation
They ain't never had the dedication
People hatin', say we changed and look, we made it
Yeah, we made it

I've got someone to make reports
That tell me how my money's spent
To book my stays and draw my blinds
So I can't tell what's really there
And all I need's a great big congratulations
Congratulations

But damn my luck and damn these friends
That keep on combing back their smiles
I save my grace with half-assed guilt
And lay down the quilt upon the lawn
Spread my arms and soak up congratulations

So don't waste your time
Trying to make anything cool, or pure, or awesome
'Cause the man is just gonna call you a (congratulations)
Fat washed up loser and crush your soul
So do yourself a favor and just give up!
Congratulations!
