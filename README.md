T-Series! (Yeah!)
It's your big day! (Woo!)
Incredible job!
I know we had our differences
But today, I just wanna tell you
A congratulations, it's a
celebration
Party all day, I know you've
been waitin' (Here we go!)
A congratulations (Woo!), it's a
celebration
I just wanna tell you that I
think that you're amazing
A congratulations to your
corporation
Guess to beat one Swedish boy,
you need a billion Asians
Yeah, you did it very nice, and
all it took
Was a massive corporate entity
with every song in Bollywood
Now you're at number one, hope
you did nothing wrong
Like starting your business by
selling pirated songs
Oops! Didn't think we'd see?
It's right there on Wikipedia
Get used to your past being held
against you by the media (Uh oh)
I'm sure right now there's
nothing that you're doing that's
illegal, yeah
I'm certain that you haven't had
collusions with the mafia
For legal reasons, that's a joke
For legal reasons, that's a joke
For serious, Indian mafia,
please don't kill me, that's a
joke
India, I'm sorry about the
memes, you're the best
I love my Indian Bros, from
Bombay to Bangladesh
I'll take on all the world for
you, I'm a heavy hitter
'Bout to cause a genocide so you
can call me Hi—
A congratulations, it's a
celebration (Oh!)
Party all day, I know you've
been waitin' (Oh yeah!)
A congratulations (Woo!), it's a
celebration (Yeah!)
I just wanna tell you that I
think that you're amazing
Congratulations (Uh)
Congratulations (It's your big
day! Woo!)
Congratulations
Congratulations (Such a big day)
I got a letter in the post, hmm,
what is this? (Hmm)
T-Series saying "Cease and
desist"
Had a problem with me telling
them to hold their defecation
But let me educate you, silly,
that's not defamation (Woo)
T-Series can eat a dick (Still
not defamation)
Suck my fucking Swedish
meatballs (Still not defamation,
yum)
Did you know that Indians have
poo-poo in their brains?
That's a blatant racist lie
Yeah, but still not defamation!
(Woo)
India got YouTube figured out,
that's sick, son
How 'bout next you figure how to
fix the caste system? (Oof)
Maybe all those ads will solve
your crippling poverty
But looking at T-Series' past,
I'm guessing not probably
But never mind the poor people,
we just here to party
Just here to pop some bottles
with the 9-Year-Old Army
Non-alcoholic 'cause I had a
real problem
But we still out here living
like we 'bout to kamikaze
So this is it, thanks for
sticking with my channel
Ever since I was a nobody,
screaming at barrels
Yeah, this is it, it's been an
adventure
It's the end of the reign of
Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg
Through all the change and
controversy, you've been by my
side
There's no army in the world, I
would rather give me watch time
It's been a wild ride, so while
I can still be heard
Here's one last brofist from the
number one in the world
A congratulations, it's a
celebration (Oh)
Party all day (Skrra), I know
you've been waitin' (Yeet, party
all day, yeah)
A congratulations (Woo!), it's a
celebration (Oh)
I just wanna tell you that I
think that you're amazing
Congratulations (Oh, ooh hoo)
Congratulations (Skrattar du,
it's your big day!)
Congratulations (I'm fucking
lit!)
Congratulations (Such a big
day!)
Oh yeah, yeah
Congratulations, T-Series! You
did it!
Yatta desu ne
Hope that #MeToo stuff doesn't
severely affect your bottom line
